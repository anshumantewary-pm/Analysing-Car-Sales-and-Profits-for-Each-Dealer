#Car Sales Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project analyzes car dealership sales data to evaluate overall business performance. The objective is to understand which dealers sold which car models, how much revenue was generated, and how much profit was earned. The analysis helps identify high-performing dealers, best-selling models, and profitability trends across regions and time periods.

Problem Statement
Car dealerships generate large volumes of transactional data, but without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:
Track dealer performance
Identify the most profitable car models
Compare regional sales trends
Monitor revenue and profit growth
Make data-driven inventory and pricing decisions

This project aims to transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following fields:
Dealer Name
Car Model
Brand
Units Sold
Selling Price
Cost Price
Sale Date
Region

Derived Metrics:

Revenue = Selling Price × Units Sold
Profit per Unit = Selling Price − Cost Price
Total Profit = (Selling Price − Cost Price) × Units Sold
Profit Margin = Total Profit ÷ Revenue
